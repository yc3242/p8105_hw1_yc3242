We use the tidyverse library through the whole problem set.
```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

```{r p1_create_df}
df_p1 = tibble(
  vec_num = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logi = vec_num > 2,
  vec_char = c("j", "O", "O", "N", "h", "e", "e", "K", "W", "n"),
  vec_fac = factor(c("upper", "lower", "lower", "upper", "upper", "lower", 
                     "upper", "upper", "lower", "upper"))
)
```

```{r p1_mean}
mean(df_p1$vec_num)
mean(df_p1$vec_logi)
mean(df_p1$vec_char)
mean(df_p1$vec_fac)
```
The mean of numeric and logical vectors can be calculated in that they are numerical variables. 
However, that of character and factor vectors cannot be taken because they are categorical variables.
